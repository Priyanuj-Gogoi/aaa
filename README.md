## BDFD Docs (Rewrite in Docusaurus)
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f8925671-2abb-4c33-8f36-c8acd289e116/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/bdfd-docs/deploys)

**Work in progress!!**\
I do this project in my free time only and i don't have any estimate date to complete

### Why are you making a new wiki when there is already an existing one?
The current wiki lacks in terms of many features like translations, better ui, docs etc.
So, i have decided to make a better version of the current one.

Visit https://bdfd-docs.netlify.app to preview the current docs progress

### Next Progress
- Syntax Highlighting (Partially done)
- API (In progress)
- Docs
- Translations
- Update overall website design
